​	 C0 Compiler is a naive-C compiler which includes basic structures of a normal compiler. such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, symbom tab consturction, mid-code generation, object-code generation and some selected optimization.

​	 **Pipelined 5-stage CPU** is a mips CPU with the architecture of 5-stage pipeline -- **IF, RB, ALU, DM and WB**. This CPU also solves instruction hazards with halts and forwards. External devices, interuptions and exceptions are allowed in the meanwhile.
